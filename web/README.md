# Web UI for Codebase Visualization

This web application provides a user interface for visualizing codebase dependencies as a graph. It is built using React and Cytoscape.js. The application fetches data generated by the Go-based parser and renders an interactive graph, allowing users to explore the relationships between files and modules in a codebase.

## Key Features

-   **Interactive Graph Visualization:** Displays codebase dependencies using Cytoscape.js, enabling users to pan, zoom, and explore the graph.
-   **React-based UI:** Provides a responsive and intuitive user interface built with React.
-   **Data-Driven:** Visualizes data generated by the Go parser, representing file dependencies and relationships.

## Data Source

The data visualized by this application, located in the `public/data` directory, is generated by analyzing the `open-webui` GitHub repository.
